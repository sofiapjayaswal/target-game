# target-game
For this game, I have two classes, bullseye.py and circle.py, that create the objects needed in my game. The circle.py class defines the individual circles in each target. The bullseye.py class creates objects that are made up of three circle objects. Each class has update and draw methods that are used in my driver, target_driver.py, which creates the game. In this driver file, I create 100 Bullseye objects and use the update method on each of them to move them. I also have my key press and mouse press callback functions. Whenever the mouse is pressed, it checks whether the mouse is within any of the targets on the screen and if it is, it deletes this target off the screen and adds points accordingly. If the mouse is not within any target, a game-over screen will be displayed with your score and current high score. To restart the game, you can press the key 'r'.
